### About Me ðŸ‘‹  
Hi, Iâ€™m Ashley. I like building things that are useful (mostly to me idk if anyone has the problems i have lmao), fun, or occasionally just weird. I mostly work on random tools or scripts that do things for me so i can be lazy, but I do some other nerd shit sometimes that's actually interesting, or it would be interesting if i ever finish it LOL. 

- ðŸŒ± **Currently into:** C/C++ 
- ðŸŽ¯ **Side quests:** none
- ðŸŒ€ **Fun fact:** they used to make soap out of corpses in the olden times :^)
